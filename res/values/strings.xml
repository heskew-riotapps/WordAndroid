  	<string name="quick_rules_1">To start the game, a letter of the first word must be placed on at least one of the smiley faces.</string>
  	<string name="quick_rules_2">Then take turns forming valid words by dragging letters from your tray to the board. At least one of your placed letters must connect to (or be placed on top of) letters already placed on the board in previous turns.</string>	
 	<string name="quick_rules_3">During a turn, be sure to place all of your letters in a single line, either vertically or horizontally.</string>	
 	<string name="quick_rules_4">If it\'s your turn, you can also skip the turn or swap letters.</string>
 	<string name="quick_rules_5">Keep it up until all the letters are used.  The player with the highest score wins.</string>

 	<string name="full_rules_subtitle">all the details</string>
 	<string name="full_rules_1">The idea is to score more points than your opponent by forming valid words out of the letters in your tray. 
                   Letters must be placed on the board in a single axis, either horizontally or vertically.  As you win more games, 
                   you\'ll earn new badges.</string>
   	<string name="full_rules_2">To start the game, the letters of the first word must placed on at least one of the smiley faces.  All words must contain 2 or more letters. 
                       The players alternate turns. Each turn after the first must 
                       place at least one letter next to a previously placed letter on the board, either to the left or right or above or below, OR overlaying 
                       a previously played letter.</string>                
 	<string name="full_rules_3">Overlays are letters that are played over a letter that was placed on the 
                       board in any previous turn.  Just remember that a player must overlay a letter with a different letter.  In other words, one 
                       cannot overlay an \"A\" with another \"A\".  The letters must be different.</string>  
 	<string name="full_rules_4">A player can skip a turn or swap letters.  
                       Swapped letters are returned to the hopper, the hopper is reshuffled, and the amount of swapped letters are pulled out of the hopper
                       and given to the player.  The player\'s turn is then skipped.  Swapping is not allowed after the hopper is empty.</string>
