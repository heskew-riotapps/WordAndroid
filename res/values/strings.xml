  	<string name="quick_rules_2">Then take turns forming valid words by dragging letters from your tray to the board. At least one of your placed letters must connect to (or be placed on top of) letters already placed on the board in previous turns.</string>	
 	<string name="quick_rules_3">During a turn, be sure to place all of your letters in a single line, either vertically or horizontally.</string>	
 	<string name="quick_rules_4">If it\'s your turn, you can also skip the turn or swap letters.</string>
 	<string name="quick_rules_5">Keep it up until all the letters are used.  The player with the highest score wins.</string>	
 	<string name="full_rules_option">full game rules</string>
 	<string name="full_rules_title">full set of rules</string>
 	<string name="full_rules_subtitle">all the details</string>
 	<string name="full_rules_1">The idea is to score more points than your opponent by forming valid words out of the letters in your tray. 
                   Letters must be placed on the board in a single axis, either horizontally or vertically.  As you win more games, 
                   you\'ll earn new badges.</string>
   	<string name="full_rules_2">To start the game, the letters of the first word must placed on at least one of the smiley faces.  All words must contain 2 or more letters. 
                       The players alternate turns. Each turn after the first must 
                       place at least one letter next to a previously placed letter on the board, either to the left or right or above or below, OR overlaying 
                       a previously played letter.</string>                
 	<string name="full_rules_3">Overlays are letters that are played over a letter that was placed on the 
                       board in any previous turn.  Just remember that a player must overlay a letter with a different letter.  In other words, one 
                       cannot overlay an \"A\" with another \"A\".  The letters must be different.</string>  
 	<string name="full_rules_4">A player can skip a turn or swap letters.  
                       Swapped letters are returned to the hopper, the hopper is reshuffled, and the amount of swapped letters are pulled out of the hopper
                       and given to the player.  The player\'s turn is then skipped.  Swapping is not allowed after the hopper is empty.</string>  
 	<string name="full_rules_letters_1">The Letters</string>
 	<string name="full_rules_letters_2">105 letters are shuffled and stored in the hopper until they are dispersed into the player\'s trays.  The mix of the first 100 letters is as follows:</string>                      
 	<string name="full_rules_letters_3">The final 5 letters are made up of 3 randomly chosen consonants and 2 randomly chosen vowels (A, E, I, O, or U).  The random letters will 
                        be unique, meaning that the random consonants chosen might be "P", "R", and "C", but would never be "P", "R", and "R".</string>   
	<string name="full_rules_scoring_1">Scoring</string>
	<string name="full_rules_scoring_2">Each letter has an assigned value as follows:</string>	
	<string name="full_rules_scoring_3">Bonuses</string>	
	<string name="full_rules_scoring_4">The codes on the board represent bonus values that are multiplied times various letter values that 
                            are placed during a turn.  </string>
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_bonus_2l">the value of the individual letter is multiplied by 2. </string>	
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_bonus_3l">the value of the individual letter is multiplied by 3. </string>	
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_bonus_4l">the value of the individual letter is multiplied by 4. </string>	
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_bonus_2w">the value of the word is multiplied by 2. </string>	
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_bonus_3w">the value of the word is multiplied by 3. </string>
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_5">If an overlay is placed on a bonus tile the bonus does not count.  Only the overlay\'s letter value counts.  Other bonus tiles in the same turn 
                                count normally, just not overlays. An overlays\'s letter values are are calculated as part of the value of the word if 
                                another letter is placed on a 2W or 3W.</string>  
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_6">If more than one word is formed during a turn, bonus tiles values are only assigned to the word that contained the bonus tiles.</string>
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_7">Letter multipliers are calculated before word multipliers when the score is calculated for a turn.
                                If a word lands on more than one word multiplier bonus tile, each bonus multipliers is used to determine the final score.</string>                            
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_smasher_1">Smashers</string>
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_smasher_2">Another way to earn points is to use all 7 letters in your tray in a single turn. If you use 7 letters in a single turn,
                            you\'ve played a smasher, which is worth 40 bonus points.</string>
    <string name="full_rules_finish_1">Win, Lose, or Draw</string>                        
    <string name="full_rules_finish_2">Normally, the game ends when a player uses all of the letters in his or her tray after the hopper has been emptied. 
                            The first person to finish the letters gets a bonus value added to his or her score.
                            The bonus is equal to the accumulated value of all of the letters left in the opponent\'s tray.  For instance, if a player finished out the 
                            letters (and the hopper was empty) and the opponent still had a "K", a "U", and a "B" left in the tray, a bonus of 15 points would be awarded
                            to the player in addition to the points that the turn earned.  The player with the most points after the bonus is awarded is declared the 
                            winner.  If both players have the same score, a draw is declared.</string>
    <string name="full_rules_finish_3">If 4 skips in a row happen (2 by one player and 2 by the opponent), the game is automatically stopped and a winner is determined based on the 
                                points already earned by the 2 players.  No bonus points are awarded in this situation.  If both players have the same score, a draw is declared.</string>
    <string name="full_rules_finish_4">If a player concedes the game, the opponent automatically wins, even if the player was leading at the time or the score was tied.  
                               If the player was leading (or the score was tied) when the concede button was clicked, the opponent\'s score is adjusted to be 1 point higher
                               than the player\'s score, making the opponent the winner.</string>
    <string name="full_rules_finish_5">If a turn has not been taken for 2 weeks (or so), the player whose turn is pending will automatically "concede".</string>

	<string name="gravatar_text">WordSmash uses an awesome service called Gravatar to let you have your own personal profile image. \n\nGravatar is owned by the folks that own WordPress, so it\'s a 
	    reliable and safe service.  All you have to do is sign up at Gravatar.com with the same email address you used to connect with WordSmash, upload your
	    image to Gravatar, and your G or PG-rated Gravatar will become available on WordSmash!\n\n(And not to worry, your email address is never exposed.)</string>
	 <string name="gravatar_setup_button">manage or create your gravatar</string>
	 <string name="gravatar_refresh_text">If you have already set up your Gravatar and aren\'t seeing it above (to the right of the WordSmash logo), let WordSmash fetch it again.</string>
	 <string name="gravatar_refresh_button">refresh your gravatar</string>
	  <string name="gravatar_refreshed_text">You should now be seeing your latest Gravatar above.\n\n
	      If you just updated your Gravatar and you\'re not seeing it above, try to refresh it again in WordSmash in a few minutes, since it could take 5 to 10 minutes for avatar changes to take effect at Gravatar.\n\n   
	      If you still don\'t see your Gravatar after the recommendation above, perhaps it was not updated properly at Gravatar.com, or perhaps your Gravatar is associated with an email other then %s.
